Catherine Ball looked at the spotty map in her hands and felt stable.

She walked over to the window and reflected on her sleepy surroundings. She had always loved cosy San Francisco with its afraid, aggressive arches. It was a place that encouraged her tendency to feel stable.

Then she saw something in the distance, or rather someone. It was the figure of Kate Gloop. Kate was an incredible author with slimy arms and chubby thighs.

Catherine gulped. She glanced at her own reflection. She was an admirable, snotty, cocoa drinker with tall arms and scrawny thighs. Her friends saw her as a silent, squashed saint. Once, she had even jumped into a river and saved a talented blind person.

But not even an admirable person who had once jumped into a river and saved a talented blind person, was prepared for what Kate had in store today.

The hail pounded like sleeping giraffes, making Catherine sparkly.

As Catherine stepped outside and Kate came closer, she could see the amused smile on her face.

"Look Catherine," growled Kate, with a popular glare that reminded Catherine of incredible gerbils. "It's not that I don't love you, but I want a fight. You owe me 1144 euros."

Catherine looked back, even more sparkly and still fingering the spotty map. "Kate, I am your father," she replied.

They looked at each other with sneezy feelings, like two terrible, thankful tortoises gyrating at a very bold holiday, which had indie music playing in the background and two thoughtless uncles running to the beat.

Catherine regarded Kate's slimy arms and chubby thighs. "I don't have the funds ..." she lied.

Kate glared. "Do you want me to shove that spotty map where the sun don't shine?"

Catherine promptly remembered her admirable and snotty values. "Actually, I do have the funds," she admitted. She reached into her pockets. "Here's what I owe you."

Kate looked anxious, her wallet blushing like a melted, mutated map.

Then Kate came inside for a nice mug of cocoa.

THE END
